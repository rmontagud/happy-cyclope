This is a tweaked version of the "Happy Cyclope" theme from Designer Daily for my personal blog. I liked that theme but maybe it lacks support for current WordPress features.

The original "Happy Cyclope" theme can be downloaded from http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/happy-cyclope

If you are the theme author and feel i'm doing something bad don't hesitate to contact me.
